# Assignment 1: Rust Setup and Introduction

In this assignment you set up your Rust development environment and get a first impression of the Rust programming language.

## Setup
1. Install Rust (using `rustup`) by following the instructions from the [Rust book installation chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).
2. Install the [Rust Analyzer Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
3. Test your setup by opening VS Code directly on the folder `as07_rust_intro`. 
    - Inspect the provided files.
    - Execute `cargo run`. This should compile and run the program.
    - Execute `cargo test` and fix the failing test.

## Tooling
**Cargo** is Rust's build system and package manager. It is used to create, build, and test Rust projects. Work through [chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) to make yourself familiar with Cargo by building a simple guessing game.

## Rustlings
To get a feel for the Rust language, you can work through the [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/) exercises. Just follow the instructions on the website.

Solve the exercises up to `primitive_types6.rs`. In exercise `primitive_types4.rs` you will be confronted with slices, which we will discuss in later. You can skip this exercise for now.
